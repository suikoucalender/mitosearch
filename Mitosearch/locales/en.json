	"helpingParagraph1": "The fish species composition of each eDNA sample is displayed as a pie chart at the sampling point on the map.",
	"helpingParagraph2": "Display a composition pie chart that merges samples that are geographically close by shrinking the map.",
	"helpingParagraph3": "By dragging or zooming the map, the time transition of the composition of fish species in the map area is displayed as a ledger line.",
	"helpingParagraph4": "You can display a composition pie chart or ridge line by filtering by specific fish species (enter the fish species name in the text box and click \"Filter\").",
